I was elated to see an opening for a Front Developer  role. I have experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Node.js and Next.js. Combined with my current job in full-stack web development, I am confident I have the skills to help your Company succeed.

During my job with Nixcode and Gitstart, I gained hands-on experience coding websites and applications. One of my projects was developing a web-based application for an event management client using React and Material-UI. The app helped increase their event sign-ups by 40%.  I also gained valuable teamwork and communication skills that will make me a great asset to your Company.

Similar to your Company, I am dedicated to building easy-to-use, user-friendly websites, and applications. I am inspired by the work that your Company does. I want to bring my experience in web development and my passion for finding creative solutions to help your Company excel.
